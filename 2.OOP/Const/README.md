# What is Const variable?

- A constant is a value that cannot be changed during the execution of the program.
  Once a constant is defined, its value remains the same throughout the program's execution.
  

- In object-oriented programming (OOP) in PHP, constants are defined using the "const" keyword within a class.
  A constant defined within a class is accessed using the scope resolution operator (::) and the name of the class,
  followed by the constant name.
