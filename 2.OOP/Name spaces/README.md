# Name spaces

- Namespaces are a feature of object-oriented programming(OOP)
  and are supported by several programming languages, including PHP.

## Uses

- Namespaces are used to organize classes, functions, interfaces, and other programming constructs in a logical and
  hierarchical manner. They provide a way to avoid naming conflicts and make it easier to maintain and understand code.
  
## Defining Namespaces

- We define namespaces before any code and after declare statement.
