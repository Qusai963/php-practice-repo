# Auto loading

- Composer is a dependency manager for PHP.
  It is a tool that simplifies the process of managing dependencies in a PHP project,
  allowing you to easily install and manage libraries and packages from third-party sources.
  
## How it works

- Composer works by reading a composer.json file in your project directory,
  which specifies the dependencies for your project.
